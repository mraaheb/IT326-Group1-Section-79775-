# IT326 Project â€” Lung Cancer Risk Prediction

## Project Information
This project applies data mining techniques to the Lung Cancer Risk dataset from Kaggle.  
The dataset contains demographic, lifestyle, and health-related attributes (such as age, smoking habits, alcohol use, family history, stress, and anxiety).  
Our work focuses on two major tasks:

- *Classification (Prediction):* Building models to predict whether a person is at risk of lung cancer (Yes/No).  
- *Clustering:* Grouping individuals with similar risk profiles to identify hidden patterns, such as clusters of high-risk smokers versus low-risk non-smokers.

## Motivation
Lung cancer is one of the most critical diseases worldwide and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths.  
Early prediction of risk can help in prevention, awareness, and better treatment planning.  
By applying machine learning, we aim to explore which factors (e.g., smoking, alcohol, age) contribute most to risk, and how predictive models can assist in health decision-making.
